A File browser will open. Select an image file saved on your computer &#10;     in the format of &quot;jpg&quot;, &quot;jpeg&quot;, or &quot;PNG&quot;. When you select your file a copy of the image will be loaded into this application.&#10;     If you choose an image which is larger than the screen a scrollbar will appear so you can view the entire image. Click the &#10;     button that says &quot;Choose Image Filter&quot; at the bottom of the screen.&#10;&#10;    -Next you will be taken to a new window where you can decide how you want to modify the image. At the top you will see&#10;     a color picker. Click on this icon and a drop down list of colors will be presented. At the bottom you will see a &quot;Custom&#10;     color&quot; option. Clicking on this will allow you to fully tailor the color values. Once you have decided on a color press the &#10;     &quot;Confirm Color&quot; button. The exact RGB values of your selected color will be displayed below. When you're finished click the&#10;     &quot;Submit&quot; button at the bottom of the screen to return.&#10;&#10;     -In the bottom left corner of the screen you will see the RGB values that you selected. Press the &quot;Apply Changes&quot; button&#10;      and your uploaded image will be transformed. From there you can save your new image or continue making &#10;      modifications. Note that the more times you apply color filters to the same image the stranger it may turn out.&#10;      If you don't like your new image just upload it again or open a new image and repeat the process. My favorite images&#10;      I've gotten have come when I pick a color that's similar to the dominant color in the image. The most bizzare results come&#10;      when I re-use the same image and pick vastly different colors&#10;     &#10;     &#10;&#10;This application was created by Jordan Gunter. The final version was completed on December 9 2016.  &#10;" />
